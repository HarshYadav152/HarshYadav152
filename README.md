*Git Galary screenshot*

[Live Demo 🚀](https://git-galary.vercel.app) | [Repository](https://github.com/HarshYadav152/git-galary)

A visually rich Next.js + Tailwind web app to discover random GitHub user avatars, inspect user stats, and filter by multiple criteria—wrapped in a neon / glassmorphism UI.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js (App Router, TypeScript), React, Tailwind CSS, GitHub REST API

#### ✨ Core Features
- Randomized avatar grid with shuffle
- Click-to-view user modal (repos, profile link, more)
- One-click avatar download
- Username search
- Advanced filters: repos, followers, stars, location, account type
- API rate limit + reset indicator
- Optional Personal Access Token input (boosts limit from 60 → 5,000 requests/hour)
- First-visit Terms & Conditions modal
- Responsive, futuristic glass UI
- Smart navbar (hide on scroll) + footer with tech credits

#### 🧪 Dev Focus
- Clean component architecture (`components/` driven)
- State orchestration in `page.tsx`
- Encourages experimentation with GitHub API constraints

#### 🚀 Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshYadav152/git-galary.git
cd git-galary
npm install
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

#### 🔑 Pro Tip
Add a no-scope GitHub PAT in the Developer section to explore more users without hitting rate limits.

> If you like the UI or want more data dimensions (org stats? contribution heat?), feel free to fork and extend.
